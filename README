NAME
    Unicode::Debug - debug Unicode strings

SYNOPSIS
     use 5.010;
     use Unicode::Debug;
 
     say unidebug("Héllò Wörld");

DESCRIPTION
    Makes non-ASCII/non-printable characters in a string blindingly obvious.

  Functions
   unidebug
    This function replaces "unusual" characters in strings with a Perl
    escape sequence that will have the same effect. The example in the
    SYNOPSIS outputs this:

     H\x{00e9}ll\x{00f2} W\x{00f6}rld

    Which characters are considered unusual? Everything outside the range
    \x20 to \x7F. (The \t, \r and \n characters are handled separately.)

    To ensure that unidebug is reversible, backslashes in the input are
    doubled in the output.

    Called in void context, it modifies the strings passed to it in-place.
    For example, the following will output the same as the previous example.

      my @strings = ("Héllò", "Wörld");
      unidebug(@strings);
      say(join " ", @strings);

    Called in list context, it returns modified versions of the strings
    passed to it. Another example:

      my @strings = unidebug("Héllò", "Wörld");
      say(join " ", @strings);

    Called in scalar context, it acts the same as in list context, but only
    returns the first modified string.

   unidecode
    An alias for "unidebug", to use as a drop-in replacement for
    Text::Unidecode.

  Package Variables
    OK, so global variables are perhaps not the best way to configure
    things, but we have "local" so quit complaining.

   $Unicode::Debug::Whitespace
    If set to true, debugs "\r", "\n" and "\t" as well. They are substituted
    as follows:

     "\r\n"    => "\\r\\n\n"
     "\r"      => "\\r\n"
     "\n"      => "\\n\n"
     "\t"      => "\\t"

    When false, these whitespace characters are passed through unchanged.
    False by default.

   $Unicode::Debug::Names
    If set to true, will use charnames to show character names for
    substituted characters. "Wörld" becomes:

     W\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS}rld

    False by default.
